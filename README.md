# iOS Master Node IDS
Research for Intrusion Detection System: Master node implementation for iOS


This iOS project is part of the research done in the following repository (unified deployment branch):<br>
https://github.com/jingye-xu/DistriLearn/tree/Unified_Deployment

The master node detects access points advertising their IDS servcie and automatically connects to them to collect inferences. As part of motivating versatility between any devices (including embedded devices), we implement the code in a variety of platforms, including Apple platforms using Swift.
